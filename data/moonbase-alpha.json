I was selected as one of the Launch-Collators on Moonriver (and later on Moonbeam) and been securing the network ever since 🔐 But I'm not just \"innit for the tech\" - I want to connect the people 👥 with the tech 💻. So I became a moderator in the official Moonbeam discord and tried to help people solving their problems wherever I could. As german 🇩🇪 is my native language, I also became admin of the german Telegram group. I always wanted to help driving this project to success and kept up steady conversations with the core team. In late 2022 I became a Treasury Council Member, which I'm still super honoured to be part of - bringing in my technical knowledge to properly evaluate the proposals. Last but not least I wanted to point out that I'm not only into Moonbeam and Moonriver Governance, but also got a track record being a gov Delegate on Kusama and Polkadot, serving as Councillor for HydraDX and Basilisk, or acting as Identity Registrar on several chains. No matter what you want to talk about - you can always reach out to me 🙏",

Moderator - Moonbeam/River Unofficial (Official) and Moonbeam RU telegram groups. Validator, and menthor in Validator school. One of the early testers - community delegate programm. As senior ambassodor now I more focused to represent Moonbeam in Indonesia at the local official Polkadot Hub and at various events that take place here. Telling people about our amazing blockchain and looking for new projects for our ecosystem. Has already acted as a panel speaker from Moonbeam network on Soulbond event and in Aurora ru community. Here in Indonesia with a team of enthusiasts, we are now developing a program of education in the crypto area. We want to provide a free educational opportunity for the local people. I also hope that next year we will be able to launch the Moonbeam academy offline/online program based on Bali Blockchain Center(BBC) and official Polkadot Hub. I work on academy idea with Polkadot ambassadors - Six and Gabo. You can find more information about BBC in our small video or in AMA on Moonbeam Binance Live channel which we organized with Yuki (Moonbeam Chinese community manager). I find governance to be a very interesting and responsible job. And most importantly, it is an opportunity to influence the decisions made on the network. I would be proud to become your community delegate and represent the interests of both the community and the ecosystem. I believe that the idea of a community delegate will help us make our network more decentralized. What is extremely important and what Purestake and the Moonbeam foundation are actively striving for. And I am also sure that a similar solution will be used in other networks. Community delegates are exactly the people who should take an active part in the governance. And if you do not have enough time to understand the various proposals, just choose for yourself the community delegate you trust the most.
