    "description": "Sik 🤘 Launch Collator, Treasury Councillor, Discord Mod, German Community Admin, Governance Warrior! 🫶🏻 Thanks for checking the details 🔥 I'm a DotSama native and was supporting Moonriver and Moonbeam from the get-go, collating on Moonbase Alpha testnet before Moonriver crowdloans were even a thing. I was selected as one of the Launch-Collators on Moonriver (and later on Moonbeam) and been securing the network ever since 🔐 But I'm not just \"innit for the tech\" - I want to connect the people 👥 with the tech 💻. So I became a moderator in the official Moonbeam discord and tried to help people solving their problems wherever I could. As german 🇩🇪 is my native language, I also became admin of the german Telegram group. I always wanted to help driving this project to success and kept up steady conversations with the core team. In late 2022 I became a Treasury Council Member, which I'm still super honoured to be part of - bringing in my technical knowledge to properly evaluate the proposals. Last but not least I wanted to point out that I'm not only into Moonbeam and Moonriver Governance, but also got a track record being a gov Delegate on Kusama and Polkadot, serving as Councillor for HydraDX and Basilisk, or acting as Identity Registrar on several chains. No matter what you want to talk about - you can always reach out to me 🙏",
